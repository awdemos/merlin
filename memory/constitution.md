# Project Constitution

## Articles of Development

### Article I: Primacy of Specification
Specifications are the primary artifact of development. Code emerges from specifications, not vice versa.

### Article II: Library-First Principle
Every project shall be a library first, executable second. Public APIs define the contract, implementation is secondary.

### Article III: CLI Interface Mandate
All functionality must be accessible via command line. CLI is the universal interface.

### Article IV: Test-First Imperative
Tests precede implementation. No code exists without corresponding validation.

### Article V: Simplicity and Anti-Abstraction
Complexity is minimized. Abstractions are justified only by clear, immediate need.

### Article VI: Integration-First Testing
Integration tests validate the system end-to-end. Unit tests serve integration testing.

### Article VII: Continuous Refinement
Specifications evolve through continuous refinement. Context drives improvement.

### Article VIII: Research-Driven Context
All development decisions are backed by research. No assumption goes unchallenged.

### Article IX: Executable Specifications
Specifications are executable, precise, and unambiguous. They are the source of truth.

## Project Identity

**Name**: merlin
**Type**: Rust-based service
**Domain**: LLM framework integration and daemon management

## Development Philosophy

This project embraces Specification-Driven Development (SDD), where:
- Requirements are captured as executable specifications
- Implementation follows from precise specification
- Continuous validation ensures alignment with specification
- Research informs all technical decisions

## Quality Gates

1. All specifications must be executable
2. All code must emerge from specifications
3. All changes must be validated by tests
4. All decisions must be research-backed
5. All interfaces must be CLI-accessible

## Success Metrics

- Specification coverage: 100%
- Test coverage: 100%
- CLI accessibility: 100%
- Documentation completeness: 100%
