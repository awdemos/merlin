# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Merlin: The AI Routing Wizard  
*Intelligent multi-provider LLM routing intended for RegicideOS*  

## Overview  
Merlin is a AI router that intelligently selects optimal language models based on real-time performance metrics. Built for developers who demand reliability and efficiency in their AI workflows.

## Features  
‚ú® **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local GGUF  
üéØ **Smart Routing**: Epsilon-greedy & Thompson sampling algorithms  
‚ö°Ô∏è **Real-Time Metrics**: Latency, cost, and quality tracking  
üîÆ **Quality Judging**: On-device GPT-2 reward modeling  
üìä **Observability**: Tracing, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards  

## Quick Start  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/regicideos/merlin.git
cd merlin

# Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/merlin serve --port 7777 --config ./merlin.toml
```

## Configuration Example  
```toml
[providers]
openai = { api_key = "sk-...", model = "gpt-4-turbo" }
anthropic = { api_key = "sk-ant-", model = "claude-3-opus" }

[routing]
policy = "thompson_sampling"
exploration_rate = 0.15

[telemetry]
prometheus_port = 9090
jaeger_endpoint = "http://localhost:14268/api/traces"
```

## API Usage

Once the server is running, interact with Merlin through these HTTP endpoints:

### Chat Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7777/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "What is the capital of France?",
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "response": "The capital of France is Paris.",
  "provider": "openai"
}
```

### Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

### Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:7777/metrics
```

Response:
```json
{
  "requests_total": 42,
  "avg_latency_ms": 250.5,
  "providers": {
    "openai": { "requests": 25, "avg_latency": 200 },
    "anthropic": { "requests": 17, "avg_latency": 320 }
  }
}
```
