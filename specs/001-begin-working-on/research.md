# Phase 0: Research Findings

## Storage Strategy Research

### Decision: File-based JSON storage with TOML configuration
**Rationale**: File-based storage provides simplicity, portability, and integrates well with existing Git-based workflows. JSON allows for structured data storage while TOML provides human-readable configuration. This approach avoids database complexity while meeting performance requirements (<100ms response time).

**Alternatives considered**:
- **SQLite**: Rejected due to overhead for simple feature numbering needs
- **In-memory storage**: Rejected because persistence across sessions is required
- **Redis**: Rejected due to external dependency and complexity for this use case

## TOML Configuration Best Practices

### Decision: Structured TOML configuration with validation
**Rationale**: TOML is the established configuration format in the Merlin project, providing consistency across the codebase. It offers human-readable syntax, strong typing, and excellent Rust library support (toml-rs).

**Configuration structure**:
```toml
[feature_numbering]
start_number = 1
prefix = "FEATURE-"
auto_increment = true
storage_path = "./features.json"

[feature_numbering.validation]
max_number = 9999
reserved_numbers = []
allow_gaps = true
```

**Alternatives considered**:
- **JSON configuration**: Rejected due to less human-friendly syntax for configuration
- **YAML configuration**: Rejected due to additional dependency and project inconsistency
- **Environment variables**: Rejected due to complexity for structured configuration

## Integration Patterns Research

### Decision: Library-based integration with CLI commands
**Rationale**: Following constitutional Library-First principle, the feature numbering system will be implemented as a core library with CLI commands as the entry point. This allows for easy integration into existing spec-driven workflows and enables programmatic access.

**Integration points**:
- **`/specify` command integration**: Automatic feature number assignment when creating specifications
- **Git workflow integration**: Feature numbers in branch names and commit messages
- **Documentation integration**: Automatic inclusion in specification documents

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Standalone CLI tool**: Rejected due to limited integration capabilities
- **Web service**: Rejected due to overkill for this use case and complexity
- **Git hooks**: Rejected due to complexity and potential workflow disruption

## Rust Dependencies Research

### Decision: Minimal, focused dependency selection
**Rationale**: Following constitutional principles of simplicity and security, dependencies are minimized to reduce attack surface and maintenance burden.

**Selected dependencies**:
- **serde & serde_json**: For JSON serialization/deserialization
- **toml**: For configuration file parsing
- **thiserror**: For structured error handling
- **tokio**: For async operations (consistent with existing codebase)
- **tracing**: For structured logging
- **uuid**: For unique identifier generation

**Rejected dependencies**:
- **Database connectors**: Not needed for file-based approach
- **Web frameworks**: Not implementing web service
- **Additional logging libraries**: tracing is sufficient

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: In-memory caching with file persistence
**Rationale**: To meet <100ms response time requirement while maintaining persistence, the system will use in-memory caching of feature data with periodic file writes. This provides optimal performance while ensuring data durability.

**Performance optimizations**:
- Lazy loading of feature data
- In-memory indexing for fast lookups
- Async file operations to prevent blocking
- Efficient JSON parsing with serde

## Error Handling Strategy

### Decision: Structured error types with thiserror
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing Merlin codebase patterns, structured errors provide clear debugging information and enable proper error recovery.

**Error types**:
- FeatureNumberAlreadyExists
- InvalidFeatureNumber
- ConfigurationError
- StorageError
- ValidationError

## Security Considerations

### Decision: File permissions and input validation
**Rationale**: For a file-based system, security focuses on proper file permissions and input validation to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption.

**Security measures**:
- Restrictive file permissions on feature data files
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Path traversal prevention
- Configuration file validation
