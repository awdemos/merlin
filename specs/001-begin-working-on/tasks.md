# Tasks: Feature Numbering System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-begin-working-on/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Implementation plan found and loaded
   → Extract: Rust 1.75+, serde, thiserror, tokio, file-based storage
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract Feature, FeatureNumber, FeatureMetadata, FeatureReference → model tasks
   → contracts/: feature-numbering-api.yaml, test_feature_creation.rs → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract file-based storage, TOML config → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract CLI workflow, API usage → integration tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands, HTTP API
   → Integration: storage, configuration, error handling
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have models
   → ✅ All endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
