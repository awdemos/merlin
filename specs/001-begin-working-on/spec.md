# Feature Specification: Feature Numbering System

**Feature Branch**: `001-begin-working-on`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "begin working on feature numbering etc"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description identified: "feature numbering etc"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: feature identification, numbering system, organization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: Create ’ Track ’ Reference features systematically
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Feature specifications, numbering schemes, metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need a systematic way to number and track features so that we can organize our development work, reference features consistently, and maintain a clear history of our project evolution.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the development team is starting a new feature, **When** they create a feature specification, **Then** the system automatically assigns a unique, sequential feature number
2. **Given** multiple features are being developed simultaneously, **When** team members reference features, **Then** they can uniquely identify each feature using its number
3. **Given** a feature is completed, **When** the team reviews project history, **Then** they can track the chronological order and progression of features

### Edge Cases
- What happens when feature numbering reaches high numbers (e.g., 999+)?
- How does system handle features that are cancelled or abandoned?
- What is the process for renumbering if a numbering mistake occurs?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically assign unique sequential numbers to new features
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent duplicate feature numbers within the same project
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow features to be referenced by their assigned numbers
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a mapping between feature numbers and feature descriptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST support chronological ordering of features based on their numbers
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow searching and filtering of features by number ranges
- **FR-007**: System MUST include feature numbers in all project documentation and references

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle feature number prefixing for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: different project types or modules?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST support feature number gaps for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: reserved or deprecated numbers?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature**: Represents a distinct capability or improvement to be developed
- **Feature Number**: Unique sequential identifier assigned to each feature
- **Feature Metadata**: Additional information about the feature (description, status, priority)
- **Feature Reference**: System for consistently referring to features across documentation
