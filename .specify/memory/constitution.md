# Merlin AI Router Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
All features MUST start with comprehensive specifications created using the `/specify` command. Specifications MUST include user requirements, success criteria, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria. No code shall be written without an approved specification.

**Rationale**: Ensures alignment with business needs, prevents scope creep, and provides clear testable outcomes for all development work.

### II. Library-First Architecture
Core functionality MUST be implemented as standalone libraries with clear public APIs. Libraries MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and well-documented. The binary executable serves only as an entry point to the library functionality.

**Rationale**: Promotes reusability, enables comprehensive testing, and separates business logic from application concerns.

### III. Provider Abstraction
All external AI model providers MUST implement the `LlmProvider` trait. Direct provider coupling is forbidden. The routing system MUST work with any provider implementing the trait interface.

**Rationale**: Enables multi-vendor support, facilitates testing, and allows easy addition of new providers without core system changes.

### IV. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests MUST be written → User approved → Tests MUST fail → Then implementation proceeds. Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. 100% test coverage is required for all critical routing logic.

**Rationale**: Ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and provides living documentation for the system behavior.

### V. Performance & Observability
All components MUST emit structured metrics via Prometheus. Response latency tracking is required for all API calls. Comprehensive tracing MUST be implemented for all request flows. Performance benchmarks MUST be established and monitored.

**Rationale**: Enables data-driven optimization, provides operational visibility, and ensures system reliability.

### VI. Intelligent Routing
The system MUST implement multiple routing algorithms (Epsilon-Greedy, Thompson Sampling, UCB). Routing decisions MUST be based on real-time performance metrics. Continuous learning from feedback is required.

**Rationale**: Provides optimal model selection, adapts to changing conditions, and maximizes user satisfaction.

### VII. Configuration-Driven Design
All routing policies, provider configurations, and system settings MUST be configurable via TOML files. No hardcoded configuration values are permitted. Configuration validation MUST be implemented.

**Rationale**: Enables flexibility across environments, facilitates A/B testing, and supports dynamic system adaptation.

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Requirements
- **Composition over inheritance**: Use trait-based design with dependency injection
- **No global mutable state**: All state must be explicitly managed and thread-safe
- **Async/Await**: Full async support using Tokio runtime
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with thiserror, proper error propagation

### Code Quality Standards
- **Rust Patterns**: Follow Rust API Guidelines (RAG) and idiomatic Rust
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all public APIs
- **Logging**: Structured logging with tracing crate
- **Formatting**: Automatic formatting with rustfmt
- **Linting**: Strict clippy compliance

### Security Requirements
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets must be injected via environment variables
- **Input validation**: Comprehensive validation on all API boundaries
- **API Security**: Proper authentication and authorization where applicable
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security audits of all dependencies

### Performance Standards
- **API Response Time**: < 100ms for routing decisions
- **Throughput**: Support for 1000+ concurrent requests
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management with proper cleanup
- **Latency**: Real-time performance monitoring and alerting

## Development Workflow

### Specification-Driven Process
1. `/specify` → Create comprehensive feature specification
2. `/plan` → Generate implementation plan with architecture
3. `/tasks` → Break down into executable tasks
4. `/implement` → Execute tasks following constitutional principles
5. `/validate` → Ensure compliance with specifications

### Quality Gates
- **Compilation**: All code must compile without warnings
- **Tests**: All existing and new tests must pass
- **Security**: No critical security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Performance**: Must meet established performance benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for all changes

### Code Review Requirements
- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
- Constitutional compliance must be verified
- Test coverage must be maintained or improved
- Performance impact must be assessed and documented

## Governance

### Amendment Process
- Constitution amendments require supermajority approval (2/3 of maintainers)
- All changes must be documented with clear rationale
- Amendments must include migration plans for existing code
- Constitutional changes require ratification through pull request

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible changes to core principles
- **MINOR**: Addition of new principles or substantial expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review
- Regular constitutional audits every development cycle
- Automated validation against project templates
- Community feedback incorporated into governance
- Transparency in all decision-making processes

### Enforcement
- Build checks validate constitutional compliance
- CI/CD pipeline enforces quality gates
- Maintainers responsible for upholding principles
- Technical debt tracked and prioritized for resolution

## Template Integration

### Plan Template Alignment
- Constitution checks must be integrated into `/plan` command flow
- Technical context must validate against constitutional principles
- Complexity tracking required for any constitutional deviations
- Success criteria must be constitutional-compliant

### Task Generation
- Tasks must be generated following TDD principles
- Test tasks must precede implementation tasks
- Quality gates must include constitutional validation
- Documentation tasks must be included for all features

### Specification Validation
- All specifications must pass constitutional validation
- Success criteria must be measurable and testable
- Technical requirements must align with architecture principles
- Implementation plans must follow phased approach

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Integration
- User feedback must be incorporated into routing improvements
- Performance metrics must drive optimization efforts
- Community suggestions considered for constitutional amendments
- Regular review of development processes and effectiveness

### Innovation Encouragement
- Experimentation with new routing algorithms encouraged
- Research into new AI models and providers supported
- Innovation within constitutional framework promoted
- Technical debt must be managed, not avoided entirely
